## Title of your project
"Live" mixing with the Mango Pi


## Team members
Joseph Shull
Kevin Chen

## Project description
We will be adapting the speaker setup Chris demonstrated in the class by also
implementing a microphone. We hope to be able to efficiently transpose and
process live audio, and replay it. 
By using code, we plan to modify the audio, such as adding a voice changer and
panning the sound.

## Hardware, budget
We will be using:
Electret Microphone Amplifier - MAX9814 with Auto Gain Control
PCM5102 PCM5102A AUX Stereo Digital Audio DAC Decoder Board
Adafruit I2S MEMS Microphone Breakout

This adds up to less than the $40 dollar budget.

## Tasks, member responsibilities
Joseph: Soldering, Converting Microphone input with I2S

Kevin: Modulation of the output, UI for the mixer

## Schedule, midpoint milestones
We plan on finishing soldering and hardware work by Monday.
By Wednesday, by want to have some solid functionality regarding the microphone,
and hopefully have a small deliverable.
By Thursday, we want to make some of the audio modifications, and finalize the
demo we have prepared.
On Friday, we hope to be completely done :)

## Resources needed, issues
Chris' Speaker Adaptation, and other online resources for our products, such as
the datasheets, guides, etc.
